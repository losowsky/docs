### What is The Coral Project?
[The Coral Project](https://coralproject.net) is an open source initiative by the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/) in partnership with [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/), and [The Washington Post](http://washingtonpost.com/) to help publishers of all sizes build better communities around their journalism. We’re creating tools that allow everyone feel safe, respected, and heard. This page is dedicated to providing resources to assist community management through user guides, as well as installation and troubleshooting documentation for developers.

### Tools
Alongside our guides, we are developing products to empower community members, engagement editors, journalists, and publishers. Our three tools are **Ask**, **Talk**, and **Trust**.

* **Ask** lets you easily create embeddable forms, manage submissions, and display galleries of the best responses. It’s fast, flexible, and you control the design and the data.

* **Talk** is a commenting system built from the ground up to focus on the needs of our users within the news. It also helps news sites easily integrate with our Trust tools.

* **Trust** helps identify trustworthy users by allowing moderators and users create filters based on behavior (e.g., which users “likes” match that of your journalists), and to apply actions based on behaviors (e.g., assigning abusive users to pre-moderation).
